## Senior Frontend Engineer Take-Home Assignment: Building a Secure Transaction History Module

Congratulations on considering the Senior Frontend Engineer role at our cutting-edge fintech
company! This take-home assignment is designed to evaluate your skills in building a secure and
efficient React Native module. The assignment is estimated to be completed within 3 days, but feel free to spend more or less time based on your availability and pace.

### Project Overview: Secure Transaction History Module

Your task is to create a transaction history module for our fintech app using **React Native** and
**TypeScript**. This module will allow users to view their recent transactions securely and efficiently.

## Requirements:

1. **User Authentication:**
   - [ ] Implement a simple authentication system to allow users to log in using device biometrics eg: FaceID, Fingerprint, etc.
2. **Transaction Data:**
   - [ ] Simulate transaction data using JSON objects. Each transaction should include properties like amount, date, description, and type (debit/credit).
   - [ ] Create a reasonable amount of sample transaction data (at least 20 transactions) for testing purposes.
3. **Transaction History Screen:**
   - [ ] Design and implement a React Native screen that displays a list of the user's recent transactions.
   - [ ] Each transaction should show relevant information (amount, date, description, type).
   - [ ] Sensitive data like amount should be masked by default, users can reveal it by authorising using device biometrics.
   - [ ] Implement a pull-to-refresh feature to update the transaction list.
4. **Transaction Detail Screen:**
   - [ ] When a user taps on a transaction, navigate to a detail screen displaying more information about that transaction.
   - [ ] Include all available transaction details (amount, date, description, type, etc.).
5. **Error Handling:**
   - [ ] Implement appropriate error handling throughout the module (e.g., network errors, authentication errors, etc.).
6. **Code Quality and Best Practices:**
   - [ ] Use TypeScript to ensure type safety and improve code quality.
   - [ ] Follow industry best practices for code structure, organization, and naming conventions.
   - [ ] Use React Native components effectively to create a responsive and visually appealing UI.
   - [ ] Implement proper separation of concerns (e.g., components, services, models).

## Submission:
   - [ ] Please create a GitHub repository for your project and commit your code regularly as you work through the assignment. Once you've completed the assignment, provide us with the repository URL and any additional instructions we might need to run your application and evaluate your work.
